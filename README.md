# Idea Maps for Science!
These networks of the ideas (more properly one or two-word terms) in a field will be useful in two ways. First, we will create a small application in which the user will select an individual term and see the top related terms in that field, along with the strength of their relation. This will allow users to quickly see the big picture of whatâ€™s going on in a field, and thus better direct their own literature searches and experiments. Secondly, the overall network will be analyzed for various information theoretic properties, such as decentralized searchability, small worldliness, modularity, etc. This will allow for comparison of the structure of knowledge across multiple fields (ex. chemistry vs. history), as well as over time (ex. chemistry in 1990 vs. 2008). Obviously, the simple words used do not exactly correspond with the ideas of a field, but they are close enough to give an informative picture.
